Try not to hit the walls. This is the 2nd game that i built.

## Player Experience :

Precision, Skillful.

## Core Mechanics :

Skillfully fly spaceship and avoid environmental hazards.

## Core game loop :

Get from starting point to finishing point to complete the level, then progress to the next level.
If you die in level x you start from level x.

## Game Theme

Experimental early generation spacecraft. Trying to escape from unknown planet.


## Most important features of my game :

Onion Design => All feautures need to feed the core feature and make it better.

- [x] Flying the rocket
- [x] Crushing the rocket. World collision
- [x] Level Progression (add delay invoke )


## TODO : Possible upgrades :
- [x] Audio - Particle System ( Crashing, boosting, finishing)
- [ ] Fuel
- [ ] Moving obstacles (In 3rd level)
- [x] Cheating shortcuts for disabling collisions, and level ups.


## Learning Objectives :

-  Keyboard oriented vs code using
-  Player movement
-  Level Design
-  Create cheating mechanism (for debug purposes, when the levels gets hard i need it for testing my game)
